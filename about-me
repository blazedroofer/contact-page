    <h1>About Josh</h1>
    <p>My journey with Roof It began from the ground up—literally. I started in the roofing industry as a laborer, hauling materials and learning the ropes one shingle at a time. From there, I worked my way up to become a skilled shingler, honing my craft on rooftops across countless projects. Now, as I launch my own venture, that hands-on progression gives me a real edge: I know the job inside and out, from the physical demands to the fine details that make a roof last. I've been in the trenches, so I prioritize quality workmanship, efficiency, and treating my team right—advantages that desk-bound owners often overlook.</p>
    <p>Before roofing, I played university football, where I learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and pushing through adversity to achieve excellence. I carry those principles into every job, striving to be the best roofer I can be by focusing on preparation, execution, and continuous improvement. It's what sets Roof It apart.</p>
    <p>I've watched too many company owners who never swing a hammer mismanage funds—skipping essential tools and better equipment for their workers while splurging on lavish vacations and oversized trucks they don't need. That's not me. At Roof It, every dollar goes toward building a stronger team and delivering top-notch results for our clients. Let's get your roof done right.</p>
