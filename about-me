    <h1>About Josh</h1>
    <p>From the top of a roof to the bottom of a code editor — that's my journey. I've spent my career as a roofer, fixing leaks, installing shingles, and making sure families stay dry and safe. But a few years ago, I discovered coding, and it clicked in the same way swinging a hammer does: precise, creative, and satisfying. Now I'm balancing hard hats with keyboards, raising my son, and chasing new skills every day. Web dev started as a hobby; now it's becoming part of who I am. If you're into building things (literal or digital), drop me a line — I'd love to connect.
